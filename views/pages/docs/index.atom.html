    <p>
      <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> is a <span class="text-theme">web development backend framework</span> designed
      to serve as an efficient, robust, and versatile backend systems engineering solution. 
      It is perfect as a choice for developing systems of varied complexity and purpose in a wide array of project archetypes. 
      The main philosophy of Entropy revolves around accessibility and <span class="text-theme">developer experience</span> in creating efficient, secure backend applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entropy is written in and
      operates strictly on the <a>Deno</a> TypeScript runtime. The <code>Introduction</code> module
      will make you familiar with the fundamentals of Entropy, providing you
      with a <strong>quick overview</strong> of the most significant features.
    </p>

    <p><strong>It is recommended to read this module thoroughly before proceeding.</strong></p>

    <div class="tip">
      If you are looking for detailed technical specification of the framework
      modules or further information on concrete topics, view the navigation
      bar to the side and feel free to proceed to a point of interest.

    <h2>prerequisites</h2>

    <p>
      Although this module aims to convey the basics of Entropy in a
      beginner-friendly manner, it is nonetheless recommended to consider the
      following basic prerequisites for understanding presented material.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener
          noreferrer">TypeScript</a> </strong> - Entropy utilizes TypeScript with
      native out-of-the-box support provided by the Deno runtime in order to
      ensure project scalability through a top of the range type-safety
      solution. A solid understanding of JavaScript and the fundamentals of
      TypeScript is highly recommended.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong><a>Deno</a></strong> - It is recommended to have a solid understanding
        of the main <span class="text-theme">runtime</span> for backend
        applications in the Entropy ecosystem. If you are familiar with other
        runtimes such as <code>node</code> along with <code>npm</code>, Deno is
        likely to feel natural. <strong>You are required to have Deno installed on
        your device in order to be able to work on Entropy applications.</strong></li> 
      <br>
      <li><strong>General Backend Knowledge</strong> - It is also recommended to have a
        solid understanding of <span class="text-theme">common backend
          engineering patterns and terminology</span>. This is <strong>not</strong>,
        however, a prerequisite with heavy emphasis, due to the
        beginner-friendly introductory nature of this module and the
        novice-developer accessibility of Entropy.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="info">
      The <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> learning curve is still (to
      some extent) dependent on your existing knowledge of backend development
      beyond explanations of this chapter and selected topics in concrete
      pages. 
    </div>

    <h2>installation</h2>

    <p>
      Before you are able to use Entropy, you must have the Deno runtime
      installed on your device. In order to install Deno, please follow the
        instructions under <a
          href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation">
          this link</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entropy does not require the installation of any additional tooling for
      project initialization. You can use the following command in order to
      initialize a new project through <span class="text-theme">Entropy project
      creator</span>:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">deno run -A https://deno.land/x/entropy_cli/init.ts</code></pre>

    <p>
      In order to run a local Entropy server, run the following command from
      your project folder. You should see information about the running
      <code>localhost</code> port of your application drawn from the project
      configuration.
    </p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">deno task dev</code></pre>
