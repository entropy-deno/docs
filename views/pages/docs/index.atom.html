    <h1>getting started</h1>

    <p>
      <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> is a <span class="text-theme">
        web development backend framework</span> based on and created for
      applications written on the <a>Deno</a> TypeScript runtime. This chapter
      will make you familiar with the fundamentals of Entropy, providing you
      with a <b>quick overview</b> of the most significant features.
    </p>

    <b>It is recommended to read this chapter thoroughly before proceeding.</b>

    <p> 
      The following sections of this chapter put an emphasis on introducing to
      you the basic use cases and patterns for modern backend systems
      engineering with the use of the Entropy framework.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      If you are looking for detailed technical specificaiton of the framework
      modules or further information on concrete topics, view the navigation
      bar to the side and feel free to proceed to a point of interest.

    <h2>prerequisites</h2>

    <p>
      Although this chapter aims to convey the basics of Entropy in a
      beginner-friendly manner, it is nonetheless recommended to consider the
      following basic prerequisites for understanding presented material before
      proceeding:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>JavaScript & TypeScript</b> - A solid understanding of the main
        <span class="text-theme">programming language</span> used by Entropy is
        required to write backend systems with the use of this framework.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Deno</b> - It is recommended to have a solid understanding of the
        main <span class="text-theme">runtime</span> for backend applications
        in the Entropy ecosystem. If you are familiar with other runtimes such
        as <code>node</code> along with <code>npm</code>, <span
          class="text-theme">Deno</span> is likely to feel natural. <b>You are
          required to have Deno installed on your device in order to be able to
          work on Entropy applications.</b></li> 
      <br>
      <li><b>General Backend Knowledge</b> - It is again recommended to have a
        solid understanding of <span class="text-theme">common backend patterns
          and terminology</span>. This is <b>not</b>, however, a prerequisite
        with heavy emphasis, due to the beginner-friendly introductory nature
        of this chapter. 
        <br><br>
        <b>The <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> learning curve is still
          (to some extent) dependent on your existing knowledge of backend
          development beyond explanations of this chapter and selected topics
          further in this documentation!</b></li> 
    </ol>

    <h2>the entropy framework</h2>

    <p>The framework uses <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> to provide best
    type safety. We believe that this language is the best option for secure
    Deno app development.</p>


    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>Entropy requires no installation process of any additional tooling for
    creating new projects. You can use the following command in order to launch
    Entropy project creator:</p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">deno run -A
      https://deno.land/x/entropy_cli/init.ts</code></pre>

    <p>When the installation is ready, you can launch the project:</p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">cd my-project  # Your project directory

deno task dev</code></pre>

    <p>Now you are able to explore the core concepts of Entropy in next sections.</p>
