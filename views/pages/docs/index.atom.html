    <p>
      <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> is a versatile <span
        class="text-theme"> web development backend framework</span> desgined
      to serve as a robust, efficient, and simple backend systems engineering
      solution for websites and web applications. Entropy is written in and
      operates strictly on the <a>Deno</a> TypeScript runtime. This chapter
      will make you familiar with the fundamentals of Entropy, providing you
      with a <strong>quick overview</strong> of the most significant features.
    </p>

    <strong>It is recommended to read this chapter thoroughly before proceeding.</strong>

    <p> 
      The following sections of this chapter put an emphasis on introducing to
      you the basic use cases and patterns for modern backend system
      development with the use of the Entropy framework.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      If you are looking for detailed technical specificaiton of the framework
      modules or further information on concrete topics, view the navigation

    <h2>prerequisites</h2>

    <p>
      Although this chapter aims to convey the basics of Entropy in a
      beginner-friendly manner, it is nonetheless recommended to consider the
      following basic prerequisites for understanding presented material before
      proceeding:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener
          noreferrer">TypeScript</a> </strong> - Entropy utilizes TypeScript with
      native out-of-the-box support provided by the Deno runtime in order to
      ensure project scalability through a top of the range type-safety
      solution. A solid understanding of JavaScript and the fundamentals of
      TypeScript is highly recommended.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong><a>Deno</a></strong> - It is recommended to have a solid understanding
        of the main <span class="text-theme">runtime</span> for backend
        applications in the Entropy ecosystem. If you are familiar with other
        runtimes such as <code>node</code> along with <code>npm</code>, Deno is
        likely to feel natural. <strong>You are required to have Deno installed on
        your device in order to be able to work on Entropy applications.</strong></li> 
      <br>
      <li><strong>General Backend Knowledge</strong> - It is also recommended to have a
        solid understanding of <span class="text-theme">common backend
          engineering patterns and terminology</span>. This is <strong>not</strong>,
        however, a prerequisite with heavy emphasis, due to the
        beginner-friendly introductory nature of this chapter and the
        novice-developer accessibility of Entropy.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="info">
      The <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> learning curve is still (to
      some extent) dependent on your existing knowledge of backend development
      beyond explanations of this chapter and selected topics in concrete
      pages. 
    </div>

    <h2>the entropy framework</h2>

    <p>
      <span class="text-theme">Entropy</span> is an efficient, robust,
      versatile and acessible solution perfect as a choice for developing
      backend systems of varied complexity and purpose. We have designed
      Entropy with a goal of providing a framework solution that is fit for
      <span class="text-theme">any task</span> in <span class="text-theme">any
        environment</span>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Consistent progress in maintaining the core philosophy of Entropy is
        reflected in progressing development of new features and continuous
        maintenance of existing modules trackable on our <a>GitHub</a> Entropy
        repositories.
    </p>

    <h3>Entropy Features</h3>

    <p> 
      You can utilize Entropy as a backend solution for <span
        class="text-theme">any</span> kind of web service project. Whether it's
      a single-page web application for personal use or a complex
      enterprise-grade application suite, Entropy is a great fit for building
      and maintaining the backend.
    </p>

    <p> 
      <strong>Entropy offers a wide palette of tools that help you express your
        backend logic whilst maintaining clean architecture.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>installation</h2>

    <p>
      Before you are able to use Entropy, you must have the Deno runtime
      installed on your device. In order to install Deno, please follow the
        instructions under <a
          href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation">
          this link</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entropy does not require the installation of any additional tooling for
      project initialization. You can use the following command in order to
      initialize a new project through <span class="text-theme">Entropy project
      creator</span>:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">deno run -A https://deno.land/x/entropy_cli/init.ts</code></pre>

    <p>
      In order to run a local Entrpy server, run the following command from
      your project folder. You should see information about the running
      <code>localhost</code> port of your application drawn from the project
      configuration.
    </p>

    <pre class="code-block">
      <header class="code-block__header">
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>
        <div class="code-block__control"></div>

        <p class="code-block__file">terminal</p>
      </header><code class="code-block__code language-sh">deno task dev</code></pre>
