    <h1>Introducing Entropy (docs currently in beta)</h1>

    <p>Entropy is a modern and declarative backend framework for <a href="https://deno.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno</a>. It makes it easy to create fast and secure web applications with awesome developer experience.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy and features</h2>

    <p>Entropy provides a strong architecture which makes it easier to create highly scalable apps.</p>

    <p>The framework uses <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> to provide best type safety. We believe that this language is the best option for secure Deno app development.</p>
